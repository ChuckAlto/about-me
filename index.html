    <p>Hi everyone.  My name is Chuck Altopiedi.  I was raised in pittsburgh but originally I am from Philadelphia. I spent the first two years of my life living in a multinational compound in Saudi Arabi while my father worked for Westinghouse.  My parents also brought me traveling during this time. My passport as a baby was quite impressive. My adult passport not so much.</p><br/>
    <p>At the age of 19 I moved to Indiana, Pennslyvania to attend university at The Indiana University of Pennslyvania, where after more years than most people attend university I obtained my undergraduate degree in Criminology. The month after graduating IUP I moved to Winter Park, Florida to attend Full Sail University. Full Sail is a media related school where I earned a full undergraduate degree in Film in 18 months.</p><br />
    <p>Armed with my two degrees I moved back to Pittsburgh and started working in the film industry. At the time pittsburgh was a great place to be for film.  Pennslyvania had a great tax incentive and many productions took advantage of the incentive. I found work on many productions both big budget and small. After about a year in the industry the tax incentive disappeared and with it almost all big productions.  I had to decide whether I was going to move to find work, or change directions. The film is a great and terrrible industry. I both loved and hated it.  I decided to find a job and save the money to move to LA. That is how I started working in the casino industry.  while the money wasnt great it was such a refreshing change from film. I worked 8 hour days instead of 18.  I had company health insurance. I could go home after work and have a life. less than a year into working at the casino I met a woman who would later become my wife.  That is how I stayed in the casino industry for 10 years</p><br/>
    <p>My last job in the casino industry was as a surveillance agent.Again the money wasnt great but I enjoyed the job, and I enjoyed my coworkers. But after three years working on grave shift I saw that I could either eventually move to day shift in the same position or move up in the company but be stuck on grave shift for the long term.  Since neither of these options appealed to me I decided to look outside the casino industry. I realized what I really wanted to do was get involved in coding and programming.  Which led me to Udemy tutorials and to Code Fellows.  After code fellows I would like to work for a smaller or independant game company but realistically I will work whevever will hire me at first. Though I will work on my own games independantly either way.</p>
